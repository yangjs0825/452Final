# 452Final
Final project for 452
My final project is about building a program to collect the deals information I am interested in. Based on my shopping experience and my interested products, I decide to make this program to collect the deals information from two different websites for myself:
 * One is a general deals information post website which is Slickdealsã€‚
 * The other one is UNIQLO. 
 For UNIQLO, it owns the same format of deals information for different categories. I can use the same process to deal with the different categories.

The document:
 * Python code
 * Narrative file
